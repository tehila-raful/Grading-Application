# Grading-Application
Created a Grading application in Java and SceneBuilder for a client using the Agile Development Methodology. 
This application allows teachers to insert and keep track of students' grades throughout the semester. 
Each teacher receives a course ID that can be used to log in. The teacher can insert and view a roster of the students and their grades. 
Additionally, exams and grades for each student can be added in and averages can be calculated. 
All the data is serialized and users can use their course ID to log in and view all the data.
